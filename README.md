# docker-gistie
Dockerized version of [Gistie] (https://github.com/gmarik/Gistie)

[Gistie] (https://github.com/gmarik/Gistie) is an open source Git-based pastebin implementation that enables sharing snippets(aka Gist) using simple web UI.
Every Gist is a *Git repository* thus **versioned** and **cloneable**. Heavily inspired by gist.github.com
